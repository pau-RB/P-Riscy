WARNING

The Verilog RTL in this directory has been generated from the Chisel sources in rocket-chip.
The code in pregen_rocket has NOT been implemented by the authors of P-Riscy and this repository.

A couple of configurations are kept here as a default only to avoid the need to install the tooling
required for Chisel compilation and generate new RTL every time the repo is cloned in a new machine.

DO NOT directly modify this code.
Use the rocket-chip generator to generate new RTL if a new configuration is desired.
